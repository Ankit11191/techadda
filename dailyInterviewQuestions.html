                                    <h4 class="h4">1) What is Cucumber? Why is it used?</h4>
                                    <p>Cucumber is a testing tool based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework. It is used to run functional tests written in plain text and develop test cases for software functionality. It plays a supporting role in automated testing.</p>
                                    <p>In other words, we can say that "Cucumber is a software tool used by the testers to develop test cases for the testing of behavior of the software."</p>

                                    <h4 class="h4">3) What is the main aim of the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework?</h4>
                                    <p>The main aim of the Behavior Driven Development framework is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, etc., understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.</p>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h4 class="h4">4) What language is used by the Cucumber tool?</h4>
                                    <p>The Cucumber tool uses the Gherkin language, a simple English representation of the application behavior. The Gherkin language uses several keywords to describe the behavior of applications such as Feature, Scenario, Scenario Outline, Given, When, Then, etc.</p>

                                    <hr />
                                    <h4 class="h4">6) What do you understand by a feature file?</h4>
                                    <p>A feature file is used to provide a high-level description of an Application Under Test (AUT). The first line of the feature file must start with the keyword 'Feature' followed by the description of the application under test. A feature file may include multiple scenarios within the same file, and the extension of the feature file must be ".feature."</p>

                                    <h4 class="h4">8) What is the use of the Background keyword in Cucumber?</h4>
                                    <p>In the Cucumber tool, the Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. The keyword is mostly used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.</p>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h4 class="h4">9) What is the usage of a Scenario Outline in the Cucumber tool?</h4>
                                    <p>In Cucumber, a Scenario outline is used as a parameter of scenarios. This is used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data; however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword 'Examples', which specify the set of values for each parameter.</p>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h4 class="h4">10) What do you understand by the term step definition in Cucumber?</h4>
                                    <p>In Cucumber, a step definition is the actual code implementation of the feature mentioned in the feature file.</p>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h4 class="h4">11) Which programming languages are supported by Cucumber?</h4>
                                    <p>The Cucumber tool supports multiple programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby, etc. You can also integrate this tool easily with multiple tools such as Selenium, Capybara, etc.</p>

                                    <ul class="points">
                                    <li>Cucumber is an open-source and free-to-use tool.</li>
                                    <li>It is easy to use. Even non-technical users can also understand the scenarios because of its plain text representation.</li>
                                    <li>It bridges the communication gap between various project stakeholders such as Business Analysts, Developers, and Quality Assurance personnel.</li>
                                    <li>With the Cucumber tool, we can develop automation test cases that are easier to maintain and understand.</li>
                                    <li>It is easy to integrate with other tools such as Selenium and Capybara.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4 class="h4">16) What do you understand by test harness in Cucumber?</h4>
                                    <p>In Cucumber, the test harness allows for separating responsibility between setting up the context and interacting with the browser, and cleaning up the step definition files. It collects stubs, drivers, and other supporting tools required to automate test execution in testing.</p>

                                    <h4 class="h4">17) What is the difference between RSpec and Cucumber? When should we use RSpec and when to use Cucumber?</h4>
                                    <p>RSpec and Cucumber both are the example of testing frameworks. RSpec uses traditional Unit Testing. It means it uses testing a class or part of the application in isolation from the rest of the application. So your model does what your model is supposed to do, the controller does what it is supposed to do, etc. RSpec and Cucumber both are used for Acceptance Testing, also called ATDD, BDD, etc.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Difference between RSpec and Cucumber</strong></p>
                                    <ul class="points">
                                    <li>The main difference between RSpec and Cucumber is the business readability factor.</li>
                                    <li>RSpec is mainly used for Unit Testing. On the other hand, Cucumber is mainly used for Behavior-driven development. We can also use it for System and Integration Testing.</li>
                                    <li>In Cucumber, the specifications or features are separate from the test code, so the product owners can provide or review the specification without going through the code. These are the .feature files that you make in Cucumber.</li>
                                    <li>RSpec also has a similar mechanism, but instead of describing a step with a Describe or Context, it uses the business specification to execute that statement. This approach is a little easier for developers to work with but a bit harder for non-technical guys.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Which should we use?</strong></p>
                                    <ul class="points">
                                    <li>For a core developer, it is the best choice to use RSpec. It is easier to understand for a technical person and offers a few advantages in keeping things scoped and under control because you don't have to mess up with RegExs for test steps.</li>
                                    <li>If you are building this for a client, you should choose Cucumber for Acceptance Testing and use RSpec for Unit Testing.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4 class="h4">18) What is Selenium?</h4>
                                    <p>Selenium is a web browser automation tool widely used for Functional Testing of web-based applications. Selenium supports different programming languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, C#, etc.</p>

                                    <h4 class="h4">19) What is the difference between Selenium and Cucumber?</h4>
                                    <p>Selenium and Cucumber are both open-source testing tools, and both are used for functional testing. But there are some differences between them.</p>
                                    <p>Following are some critical differences between Selenium and Cucumber:</p>
                                    <ul class="points">
                                    <li>Selenium is a web browser automation tool for web apps, while Cucumber is an automation tool for behavior-driven development that can be used with Selenium (or Appium).</li>
                                    <li>Selenium is used for automated UI testing, while Cucumber is used for acceptance testing.</li>
                                    <li>Selenium is preferred by technical teams (SDETs/programmers), while Cucumber is typically preferred by non-technical teams (business stakeholders and testers).</li>
                                    <li>Selenium can work independently of Cucumber. Cucumber depends on Selenium or Appium for step-definition implementation.</li>
                                    <li>In Selenium, the script creation is complex, while Cucumber is simpler than Selenium.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <hr />
                                    <h4 class="h4">20) Why we have to use Cucumber with Selenium?</h4>
                                    <p>Cucumber and Selenium are both testing frameworks and prevalent technologies. Many organizations use Selenium for functional testing. Along with Selenium, these organizations integrate Cucumber with Selenium as Cucumber makes it easy to read and understand the application flow. The most significant benefit of using Cucumber with Selenium is that it facilitates developers to write test cases in simple feature files easily understood by managers, non-technical stakeholders, and business analysts. It provides the facility to write tests in a human-readable language called Gherkin. The Selenium-Cucumber framework supports programming languages such as Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Perl, etc.</p>

                                    <h4 class="h4">21) What do you understand by the Step Definition?</h4>
                                    <p>Step definition is used to map the Test Case Steps in the feature files to code. It executes the steps on Application under Test and checks the results. To execute step definition, it must match the given component in a feature.</p>

                                    <h4 class="h4">22) What are the maximum numbers of scenarios that we can includ in the feature file?</h4>
                                    <p>In Cucumber, a feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios. This number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another organization. It is the best practice to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.</p>

                                    <h4 class="h4">23) What is the purpose of the behavior-driven development (BDD) methodology in the real world?</h4>
                                    <p>Behavior Driven Development or BDD is a methodology used to understand the functionality of an application in the simple plain text representation. The primary purpose of the Behavior Driven Development framework is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, Support Teams understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.</p>

                                    <h4 class="h4">24) What do you understand by TDD, and what are the different processes used in TDD?</h4>
                                    <p>TDD is an acronym that stands for Test-Driven Development. This is a software development technique used to create the test cases first and then write the code underlying those test cases. Although TDD is a development technique, it can also be used for automation testing development. TDD takes more time for development because it tends to find very few defects. The result provided by the TDD development technique has improved the quality of code, and that can be more reusable and flexible. TDD also helps developers to achieve high test coverage of about 90-100%. The only disadvantage for developers following TDD is to write their test cases before writing the code.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Following is the list of simple 6 step process used by TDD methodology:</strong></p>
                                    <ol class="points">
                                    <li><strong>First, write the test case:</strong>&nbsp;You have to write an automated test case according to your requirements.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Develop the code for that test case:</strong>&nbsp;In this process, you must write the code to make that test case work as expected if the test case fails.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Run test cases again:</strong>&nbsp;Now, you have to rerun the test cases and check if all the test cases developed so far are implemented.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Refactor your code:</strong>&nbsp;This is an optional step. But, it is advised to refactor your code to make it more readable and reusable. That's why it is essential.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Repeat steps 1- 5 for new test cases:</strong>&nbsp;This is the last step. Here, you have to repeat the cycle for the other test cases until all the test cases are implemented.</li>

                                    <p>TDD stands for Test-Driven Development, and BDD stands for Behavior Driven Development. Both are two software development techniques.</p>
                                    <p>BDD and TDD are both very similar as they are both testing strategies for a software application. In both cases, the developers have to write the test before writing the code to pass the test. The second main similarity between them is in both cases; the tests can be used as part of an automated testing framework to prevent bugs.</p>

                                <p><strong>Q #1) Explain the architecture of JMeter.</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jmeter is a Java-based open-source application that is basically designed for the purpose of Load Testing. It supports all major protocols that are supported in Load Runner. Unlike any browser, JMeter works on levels of protocols and does not execute JavaScript present in HTML web pages.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #2) Does JMeter simulate actual browser behavior?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>No, JMeter does not support the actual browser behavior. It does not render the HTML webpages as the normal browser does. The response can be viewed in HTML format but the actual timings are not present in the generated samples.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #3) What is Distributed testing?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Distributed Testing means using multiple machines for load testing in which one of the machines can be made master and others can be kept as a slave. It is very important to note that all the machines should be on the&nbsp; same network and should have the same version of Java and JMeter</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #4) What is the use of Regular Expression in JMeter?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Regular Expression is used for extracting some values dynamically from the responses.These values can be used in the subsequent request or can be saved for reporting purposes. Regular Expression is used in both Pre-Processors as well as Post Processors.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #5) What are the types of processors in JMeter?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Basically there are two types of processors in JMeter namely Pre-Processor and Post Processor.</p>
                                    <p>Pre-Processors execute before the main sampler and can change the scope of the sampler whereas Post Processors execute after the main sampler and are applicable to all samplers in the same scope of Test Plan. They can be used to extract some fields from the server response and store them in variables.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #6) What are the different ways of Data Parameterization in JMeter?<br /></strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Data Parametrization makes the scripts reusable where the values is not required to be hardcoded for the same request with different parameters.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Below is the data parametrization that is supported in JMeter:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>CSV Data Set Config</li>
                                    <li>User-Defined Variables.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Q #7) What are the maximum recommended threads on a single system?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;It depends on the hardware configuration of your system which includes a processor, JVM, allocated memory -Xmx, etc.</p>
                                    <p>Other factors that impact thread count are the number of components in your test plan i.e. the number of config elements or processors and it also depends on whether you are using GUI/Non-GUI Mode.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #8) Explain the difference between Gaussian and Poisson Timers.</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Both Gaussian and Poisson Timers work on a mathematical formula with some constant delay and additional offset. Difference between the two lies in the fact that how the lambda value is calculated in the case of Poisson timer and how deviation is calculated in the case of Gaussian Timer.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #9) What are the major differences between JMeter and Load Runner.</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;JMeter is considered as the major competitor of Load Runner in the industry.&nbsp;<strong>Enlisted are some of the major differences:</strong></p>

                                    <p><strong>Q #10) What is the use of co-relation in JMeter?<br /></strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Co-relation is a process of extracting the values from the server response and storing it in a variable to be used in any other request which is to follow.</p>
                                    <p><strong>For Example,</strong>&nbsp;for testing any login functionality if you have to use the session ID/cookie ID, you can extract the values from the response of GET Request of the login page and then dynamically use the same while making POST request for a login.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #11) What are the different types of listeners?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Listeners are used for storing the execution results of load testing in different forms be it in a table, graph, tree or in any other presentable format so that it can be presented to the client. There are different type of inbuild listeners in JMeter and many others can be imported into it by using plugins as per the requirement.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Some of the inbuild listeners are:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>View results in Table</li>
                                    <li>View results in Tree</li>
                                    <li>Graph results</li>
                                    <li>Aggregate graph</li>
                                    <li>Aggregate report</li>
                                    <li>Assertion results</li>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Q #12) Explain the flow of the Test Script Recorder.</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;HTTP(s) Test Script Recorder is used to record all the Http(s) requests going to the server from your application. Some configurations require to be done in JMeter in order to make it work.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Steps followed to record https traffic are:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Add HTTP(s) Test script recorder to WorkBench.</li>
                                    <li>Enter the port number to start your proxy server.</li>
                                    <li>Choose the target either as &ldquo;Workbench&rdquo; or add a Recording Controller in your test plan and select the same target for storing all the recordings under it.</li>
                                    <li>Start the proxy server.</li>
                                    <li>Configure your browser with manual proxy settings pointing to the same port number used in the test script recorder.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Q #13) Can JMeter record actions from mobile? If yes, how?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, JMeter can record HTTP or Https request going to the server from your mobile application also. It is required that mobile and JMeter are on the same network.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Below is the configuration required:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Configure your proxy server in JMeter to run at a specified port.</li>
                                    <li>Set up the proxy on your mobile wifi settings and enter the same port number that is used in the recorder.</li>
                                    <li>Install the Root CA certificate on your mobile.</li>
                                    <li>Hit server requests from your mobile and observe it getting captured by the specified controller.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Q #14) How to do master-slave configuration in JMeter?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Master-slave configuration is a part of distributed testing in which more than one machine is used to perform load testing of the server under test.</p>
                                    <p>It is very important that all machines are on the same network and all have the same version of JMeter. In distributed testing, one machine considered as the master and the others are kept as slaves by doing some configurations.</p>
                                    <p><strong>The process is specified below:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>On the master machine, edit the JMeter.properties file and add the IP addresses of slave machines against the remote_host field in the file.</li>
                                    <li>Save the file and open the JMeter again.</li>
                                    <li>Now, from the RUN menu in JMeter, select Remote Start and choose the IP of the machine to be invoked.</li>
                                    <li>Choose RUN menu and select Remote Start all to start all the slave machines for your testing.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Q #15) What are the JMeter supported protocols?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;JMeter<strong>&nbsp;supports various standard protocols like:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>HTTP/HTTPs</li>
                                    <li>SOAP</li>
                                    <li>LDAP</li>
                                    <li>FTP</li>
                                    <li>SMTP</li>
                                    <li>TCP</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Q #16) Explain the syntax of JMeter variables and functions.</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Just as in any other programming language, variables and functions are used in JMeter also in order to make the scripts reusable.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Syntax of Variable</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; ${var}</p>
                                    <p>There are many inbuilt functions that are available in JMeter to perform various actions. Function string can be generated from the Function Dialogue Box itself.</p>
                                    <p><strong>For Example,</strong>&nbsp;if you want to get the machine IP stored in a machineIP variable, you can use the string ${__machineIP(machineIP)}.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #17) Why is it recommended to run JMeter in GUI mode?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;JMeter tests can be run both GUI as well as Non-GUI Mode. It is highly recommended to run the load test in Non-GUI mode because the AWT event thread can kill the tests in case of high load scenarios.</p>
                                    <p><strong>The various Non-GUI mode supported with JMeter are:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Command-line</li>
                                    <li>ANT plugin</li>
                                    <li>MAVEN plugin</li>

                                    <p><strong>Q #18) Is it possible to run selenium scripts in JMeter? If yes, how?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, it is possible to run selenium scripts in JMeter to get some ideas on their performance.</p>
                                    <p>There are two ways of doing it. Either you can use JUnit libraries to build selenium scripts and save as Jars and copy the same in the JMeter directory. And then add JUnit sampler to your test plan and import the Jar file.</p>
                                    <p>Otherwise, the Webdriver sampler plugin can be added in the JMeter ext folder. Restart the JMeter. Write your selenium code in the Webdriver sampler and then execute it to see the performance.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #19) How do you manage sessions and cookies in JMeter?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Sessions and cookies can be managed in JMeter by using config elements such as HTTP Cache Manager which provides an option to clear the cookies in every iteration and also allows to add user-defined cookies.</p>
                                    <p>HTTP Cache manager helps you in clearing cache after each iteration as per your requirement in the load tests and also limits the number of elements that can be stored in the cache. Both of these config elements can be attached to the HTTP sampler.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #20) What are the important steps for testing JDBC request?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;JDBC requests are used to establish a connection with the databases and then measure the response time of the queries.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Important steps for testing JDBC requests are:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Setting up Config Element,</strong>&nbsp;JDBC Connection configuration in which Database URL and JDBC Driver Class needs to be added as per the database which is being used. Also, add the variable name for this connection configuration so as to use it in the sampler.</li>
                                    <li>Add JDBC Request. Add the same variable name added above and write your queries to the test.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Q #21) What is BeanShell scripting?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;BeanShell is a lightweight Java scripting that is used in JMeter to perform some complex task.&nbsp;BeanShell sampler can perform various functions with the use of coding. You can print the thread number, get the current sampler executed, fetch the cookies, etc.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #22) Can JMeter measure the performance of a complete application? For Example, you have multiple screens in your mobile app. Can JMeter measure the time taken to flip the screens?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;No, JMeter does not measure the transition time between the screens. It can only measure the server actions not the UI interactions.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #23) What is a Root CA certificate?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;HTTPS connection requires a certificate to authenticate the connections which get established when the browser hits the webserver.&nbsp;JMeter generates it temporarily to intercept the SSL traffic in order to record the actions. For recording actions via mobile, you need to have this certificate on your mobile to record the actions.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #24) Which factors decide the maximum threads that one should generate per system?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;It depends on the hardware of the system.</p>
                                    <p><strong>For Example,</strong>&nbsp;on a 2-3 GHz CPU, 400-600 threads can be generated. It also depends on the components in your test plan. More the processors and XML parsing elements, the more the CPU load and hence fewer threads. For high load, it is recommended to use multiple machines for load testing.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #25) What is a Workbench and why is it required?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Workbench is a storage area for adding some components which can be added to the test plan if required.</p>
                                    <p>Components of workbench do not get saved with the test plan automatically. They have to be saved separately as test fragments. A most important part of the Workbench is HTTP(s) Test script recorder which is highly useful in recording the https request and later load can be applied to+9859 them to measure the response time.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #26) What is Tidy Parsing?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Tidy Parsing is a type of parsing that is used in Xpath extractor.&nbsp;If the response is in pure XML then tidy parsing is not required whereas, in the case of XHTML, it is mandatory to check the tidy parsing option in order to fetch the correct results.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Q #27) What are the important plugins that are supported in JMeter?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;JMeter supports different types of plugins which are helpful in generating high-quality results.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Below are the major plugins that are supported:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Q #28) What are the types of the controller in JMeter?</strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Controllers are used in JMeter to control the flow of execution of requests.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Below are the controllers that are used in JMeter:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Recording controller</li>
                                    <li>IF controller</li>
                                    <li>While controller</li>
