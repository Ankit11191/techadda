                                    <p>If you think I have missed any test scenarios or test cases, then do let me know in the comments. I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you share the post on social media.</p>

                                <p>We are going to take a look at those small changes along with the test scenarios. A few things to consider while testing a logout feature are &ndash; security, accessibility, and HTTPS support. These are the things that most modern web apps require for safe and accessible usage.</p>
                                <p><strong>Here are some of the test cases and scenarios for the logout functionality:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Make sure the app allows a single sign off from all the devices.</li>
                                <li>Make sure the app lets you sign off for multiple accounts.</li>
                                <li>Does the app clear cookies after sign off?</li>
                                <li>Does the app clear the session for the user after sign off?</li>
                                <li>Does the app remember the username after signoff?</li>
                                <li>Does the app take more time for signoff at different connection speeds?</li>
                                <li>Is the sign off link easy to find?</li>
                                <li>Is the sign off link or button easy to click?</li>
                                <li>Is the sign off link or button positioned as per specification?</li>
                                <li>Is the sign off button or link readable?</li>
                                <li>Does the power outage retain the session if not signed off?</li>
                                <li>Does the sign off functionality require face recognition or fingerprint (in case of the desktop app)?</li>
                                <li>Does the sign off page redirect to the page where it allows login?</li>
                                <li>Does the sign off page allow redirection to the home page?</li>
                                <li>Is sign off page going to remove the window or tab automatically? (If it&rsquo;s bank account sign off link)</li>
                                <li>Does the sign off button or link work on all devices?</li>
                                <li>Is the sign off button or link broke after clicked?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Accessibility Test Case For Logout</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Is the logout link or button easy to use?</li>
                                <li>Does the link or button recognizable?</li>
                                <li>Is the link or button easy to find?</li>
                                <li>Is the link or button for logout accessible for all users?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Security Logs&nbsp;Test Case For Logout</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Check the logs for the login and logout session.</li>
                                <li>Check if the logs contain multiple IPs for a single ID at the same time.</li>
                                <li>Check if the logs contain a denial of service attack for the login or log out.</li>
                                <li>Check if the unauthorized IP makes a request for the logout.</li>
                                <li>Check if the log has suspicious activity.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>HTTPS Logout Page Test Cases</strong></p>
                                <p>Most of the member areas are secured with HTTPS. However, we have to test the code in both productions and on the release server. So we have to check whether the https remains on both signs-in and sign-out pages. Like the sign-in page, it has to be encrypted as well.</p>
                                <p>The HTTPS certificate has to be genuine and should be easy to verify. It should not be expired while using the sign-in or sign-out. Make sure the security service provider for the HTTPS certification is genuine and supports a 128 bit SSL connection.</p>
                                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                                <p>These are some of the test cases you can use for testing the sign-off or the logout functionality of the web app. If it&rsquo;s a desktop app then the working would be slightly different and the test cases will be different too.</p>
                                <p>I hope this post helps you answer some of the questions related to the manual testing interview. Do let me know if you can think of additional test cases. I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you share the post on social media.</p>

                                <p>There are many other additional tests, but these are the ones that you can come up with when you have no visual idea of the pen and also don&rsquo;t know the specification of the product. I hope these test cases help you with interviews or while discussing it with peers. Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions or comments.</p>
